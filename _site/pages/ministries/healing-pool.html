    <h3>What It Is</h3>
    <p>
      This practice is based on the scriptural authority of John 5: 2 – 4 ‘Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep 
      market pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five porches. In these lay a great 
      multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went 
      down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosever then first after the troubling of 
      the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had’.
And John 13: 3 – 10 ‘Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that he was come from 
 and went to God. He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded Himself. After 
 that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciple’s feet, and to wipe them with the towel 
 wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto Him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? 
 Jesus answered and said unto him, what I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.
Peter saith unto Him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, if I wash thee not, thou hast no part with 
me. Simon Peter saith unto Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus saith to him, he that 
is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all’.
At the ATG, Nairobi Chapel, the service is held once per month on the third Sunday. In this service a PVC canvas is 
used to make an estimated 3 metres by 2 metres long container of about 2 feet high. In it normal ‘City Council 
Water’ is put occupying the whole container and then the Apostle consecrates it with prayer and a pint of anointing 
oil. The canvas full of ordinary water is now transformed into a spiritual healing pool.
Consecrated and Sanctified, the water becomes a healing pool similar to the pool of 'Bethesda in John 5 and whosever
 goeth into the pool is healed of whatever disease or situation they may so seek.
The Apostle and his associate pastors clad in their priestly regalia step into the water with a crucible of 
anointing oil. The worshippers then take their shoes off and one by one (as many as seek the spiritual anointment) 
pass through the pool. Some praying, others praising but all focused on God and their desired miracles. As each one 
of them steps into the water he or she is anointed by the Apostle and the associate pastors on the forehead and on 
the palms of their hands.
Now! Since the pool is an altar hovered over by the Spirit of God (upon consecration) of the water by the Apostle, 
many things could and do happen during the service. The sick (like my friend) get healed, demons flee, spiritual 
and witchcraft curses break e.t.c.
These services are so power – charged that the ushers work overtime carrying many who get overwhelmed by the power 
of God and fall or cannot walk properly under the heavy anointing present.
That it is called the Healing Pool does not just mean healing from physical illness only. Neither is it exclusively 
for the sick. It means all round healing:- physically, mentally, emotionally, socially, financially, sexually, 
spiritually e.t.c.
When you hit that pool, your problems (whatever they might be) officially get convicted at the courts of Heaven and 
are sentenced to leave you at once and never come back again.’
And just as God said in Genesis 1: 6 – 7 ‘.Let there be a firment in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the 
waters from the waters’. God uses the water in the healing Pool to separate a person from any other type of 
satanically manipulated waters. The water in the Healing Pool is the Water that separates good from evil
Now! The Healing Pool experience can only be activated through the engaging of faith. One truth about faith is that 
it cannot be challenged because it continues to be solely an individual’s experience. It is impossible for a person 
to understand a faith issue unless they have had a faith-based encounter.
This is why at the end of the Healing Pool and Feet Washing Service you will see members of the congregation rushing
 to fill all sorts of containers with the same water that they had walked through. They take this water to their 
 homes where they use it to bless their homes, businesses, farms, etc.
The power of the Holy Spirit upon the water does not remain in the sanctuary. No! it follows whoever carries the 
water to wherever they take the water and whatever they decree as they use the water. When the water is taken; for 
example, into a home and the water is used for cleaning, don’t be surprised if a person testifies that the water 
rose above the physical mountains the person was experiencing, and that the demonic strongholds that had held the 
person bound have been overpowered. The Healing Pool Water cleanses, heals and restores former glory.
