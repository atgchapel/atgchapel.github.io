        The Feet Anointing Service is a Christian based ritual of walking a person through anointed olive oil mixed 
        with salt: This action accompanied with prayer results into spiritual and physical deliverance for the 
        believer. It seems a simple physical action to the human eye, but it has a very deep spiritual meaning....

      <h4>
        Is it Biblical or is it simply a religious gimmick to siphon money from unsuspecting worshippers?
      </h4>
      <p>
        This practice is based on the scriptural authority of Deuteronomy 33:24 – 25 “And of Asher, he said; let 
        Asher be blessed with children, let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil. 
        Thy shoes shall be iron and brass, and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.”
        And also Joshua 1:3 which says: “Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given 
        unto you, as I said unto Moses”.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>The rationale:</h4>
      <p>
        Symbolic Significance of Human Legs: God gave you legs for three main purposes. One; to support your body, 
        Two; to give your body strength and Three; to walk you in the paths of righteousness and in the ways that 
        will profit you: A human leg is divided into two parts. The portion from the knee to the hip: This upper 
        part is called the thigh and it is a symbol of equalizing our walk. The lower part is from the knees to the 
        soles and for the purpose of this message I shall refer to as the ‘LEG’. A point to take note of is that 
        the thigh is important in the movement of the whole leg and if it is injured, the lower part from the knee 
        to the sole cannot function.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Our feet are a symbol of our walk with God:</h4>
      <p>
        The description of the statue in king Nebuchadnezzar’s dream in the book of Daniel, states that its feet 
        were of iron the least noble of all the other metals previously mentioned. Having feet that are a mixture of 
        iron and clay could mean having some amount of strength but strength which is mixed with weakness: Iron on 
        its own has some strength but mixing it with clay does more harm than good. A person whose feet are alienated 
        from God misses out on God’s blessings.
        God gives you legs to take you to where you can eat the good of the earth. For example; it is your feet that 
        walk you into big offices and well -paying companies where you secure good jobs. It is your legs that take you 
        to lucrative business locations. BUT! Time spent in such offices depends a great deal on how well your feet 
        are positioned in the spiritual realm.
        When God says He has good plans for you and I; one of the things that He is saying is that ‘I have given you 
        legs to take you to where I have destined you to go and to be’. Although the scripture in Jeremiah 29: 11 is 
        very often emphasized by preachers and believers all over the world, the sad truth is that; for many people, 
        their legs tend to do the opposite of God’s Will for them.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>What is God's Will for us?</h4>
      <p>
        In accordance to Psalm 23 Our shepherd intends that our legs take us to green pastures and to quiet waters. 
        He wants our legs to walk along right paths and to take us to dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of 
        our lives.
        God wants us to possess wherever Our Soles Tread: The promises of God are aye and amen. He has spoken a 
        great deal about the power He has put inside the soles of our feet.
        In Deuteronomy 11: 24 Moses spoke to the Israelites concerning God’s Will for them. Moses said ‘Every place 
        the sole of your foot treads shall be yours. Your territory shall extend from the wilderness to Lebanon and 
        from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea. No one will be able to stand against you, the LORD your 
        God will put fear and dread of you in all the land where you set foot, as He promised you’.
        So God wants us to operate in power and authority. He wants us to take charge of every environment we go 
        into. But this power is the very thing that our enemy fights. He causes people to go in the direction that 
        leads them away from their destiny and blessings. But what do we see happening with the various parts of 
        our legs?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Satan attacks our legs:</h4>
      <p>
        When Adam and Eve disobeyed our Creator, God said to the serpent in Genesis 3:15 ‘I will put hostility 
        between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed. He will strike your head and you will strike 
        his heel’.
        The devil knows his rights alright. He also knows the scripture very well, so he takes advantage of God’s 
        words that say …. you will strike his heel…. and uses sin to fight you with all means and in all directions.
        We neglect the Knee: Yet a Symbol of Reverence and Humility: We have become negligent with our use of the 
        knee as a prayer position. Our knees get tired after only a minute or two of prayer. Gone are the days when 
        believers spent quality time on their knees before the LORD. Gone are the days when believers would go on 
        their knees to worship and exalt God. We have forgotten that our forefathers spent more time in the presence 
        of God while on their knees than while standing or sitting.
        What we see happening today with many of us, is that the act of going down on our knees has been left to when 
        we have a shopping list of wants and needs to present to God. How then can we be surprised that God’s 
        revelations are hard to come by?
        To kneel is to humble ourselves. Why do we want to be humble only when we are desperately trying to extract 
        something from God? If we do not exercise knee-ology how shall we produce effectual and fervent prayer? Yet 
        James 5: 15 states very clearly that ‘the effectual and fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much’. 
        God does not want our prayers to get stuck at the gates of heaven; He wants our prayers to reach His throne 
        in the inner courts.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Satan Uses People Who Know Us to Fight Us:</h4>
      <p>
        The enemy has caused Household and Workplace Wickedness to thrive in homes and places of work such that your 
        relatives, friends, neighbours, workmates and other people around you are the very people who hurt, fight, 
        destroy; and if you don’t get help, kill you.
        The Psalmist lamented in Psalm 41:9 saying ‘Even my friend in whom I trusted, one who ate my bread has lifted 
        up his heel against me’. And Jesus Christ as He taught about the importance of feet washing said in 
        John 13: 18 “I am not speaking about all of you. I know those I have chosen, But the scripture must be 
        fulfilled. The one who eats My bread has raised his heel against Me’.
        This is why as you live, serve, work or associate with people you need to constantly seek God’s guidance. 
        Through God’s guidance you shall know how you should function, where you should function and how you should 
        function. When you allow God to lead you, He shall preserve you and you shall have peace. One way of God’s 
        preservation is through the Feet Anointing Service.
        The devil uses the spirits of vagabondism, loitering, circumnavigating, stagnation and snail or tortoise 
        anointing to keep God’s people moving further and further away from where their destiny connectors are, from 
        where their source of help is and from where God intended them to be. This is why you find some people moving from 
        one church to another, saying they have been looking for God, yet they left God’s Will for them in the very first church He had directed them to. Others keep going in circles, attending church and skipping church, others keep starting businesses and projects that never flourish, and even others keep applying for college, paying and never attending class. All these are ways that the devil uses to cause confusion in the lives of people.
        When Joshua got worried about his new role, God promised him victory saying in Joshua 1: 3 ‘I will give you 
        every place where you set your foot ….’ And as God explains to us what He wants us to do to our enemy’s, 
        Malachi 4: 3 states ‘Then you will trample down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet 
        on the day I am preparing, says the LORD of Hosts.
        Satan knows that we have been given the power to trample down the wicked ones and by doing so we have the 
        ability to convert them into ashes under the SOLES of our feet. This is why he leads us in the wrong direction.
        For a person to be able to stand against the adversary, he or she needs help from a servant of God who has 
        walked in spirit and in truth with Jesus Christ. The scripture says that the yoke is destroyed by the anointing.

      <h4>What Does God Say About Our Feet?</h4>
      <p>
        Our Iniquity Causes Spiritual Wounds and Festering Sores Prophet Isaiah must have stared in extreme shock 
        at the vision that God gave him concerning Judah. The initial words of the Almighty must have sent cold 
        shivers down Isaiah’s spine as he listened. This is what God said to Isaiah? Isaiah 1: 2 says ‘Listen 
        heavens and pay attention earth, for the LORD has spoken while verse 4 says ‘Oh sinful nation, people 
        weighed down with iniquity, brood of evil doers … And then God asked in verse 5 and 6 ‘Why do you want more 
        beatings? Why do you keep on rebelling? The whole head is hurt and the whole heart is sick. From the sole 
        of the foot to the top of the head, no spot is uninjured, wounds, welts, and festering sores not cleansed, 
        bandaged or soothed with oil. And in verse 7 God summed up the situation by saying ‘Your land is desolate, 
        your cities burned with fire before your very eyes. Foreigners devour fields. Daughter Zion is abandoned 
        like a shelter in a vineyard, like a shack in a cucumber field like a besieged city’. What Isaiah was told 
        by God is simple. Our earthly sinful lifestyles contribute a great deal to how we are positioned in the 
        spiritual realm. You cannot lead a life of iniquity and expect to stand in your position of authority in 
        the spirit realm. Your feet are what you use to take you to and to take you from where you go to commit sin. 
        Each time you carry un-repented sin you cause your feet to have spiritual sores and wounds. And when your 
        life is engulfed in iniquity your whole heart is strangled by the spirits of bitterness, anger, fear, 
        un-forgiveness, infirmity and other spirits that live in the nest of soul sickness... Your head is not spared 
        either. Sin, iniquity or transgression brings in the spirits of confusion, double mindedness, crab walking, 
        circumnavigation, memory loss, insanity or mental stagnation. When your whole self is infested with spiritual 
        sickness, your life becomes desolate because you are unable to tend it properly. Evil people or demons invade 
        what God has given you and possess it. And your life is as of one who has been surrounded by the enemy. In 
        Deuteronomy 33: 24 - 25 through the mouth of Moses, the LORD Almighty spoke and said ‘May Asher be the most 
        blessed of the sons; may he be the most favoured among his brothers and dip his feet in {olive} oil. May the 
        bolts of your gates be iron and bronze and your strength last as long as you live’. Remember when we looked 
        at the statue that king Nebuchadnezzar saw in a dream, we read that the statue’s legs were made of iron and 
        clay, BUT long before Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, God had already spoken and said that our gates be iron and 
        bronze. What we have read in Deuteronomy is evidence of the type of spiritual legs purposed for us by God, 
        what we read about the statue in the book of Daniel is the condition that satan wants our legs to be in. Now 
        whose report are you going to accept? Will it be God’s report or the devil’s? Why start with the soles of the 
        feet and not the top of the head? In Deuteronomy 28: 35 it is written concerning what happens when we disobey 
        God’s commandments. It says ‘The LORD will afflict your knees and legs with painful boils that cannot be 
        cured, spreading from the soles of your feet to the top of your head’. A good question to ask yourself is why 
        did God state that the boils would start with ‘spreading from the soles of the feet’ and not start from the 
        top of the head? Maybe what really matters in a person is being at the right place at the right time. The way 
        Jacob did. His twin, Esau was away in the forest yet his father was just about to conduct a rite that was 
        going to make generational impact. Jacob being at the right place at the right time ended up receiving the 
        blessing and when Esau came back every good thing had been taken away from him for - ever.

    <div>
      <h4>Your Feet Must Be Properly Positioned Spiritually:</h4>
      <p>
        You might have brilliant ideas, but your feet must be at the right place for a positive impact to sprout. 
        So don’t be surprised that there are very many intelligent people, some well - educated who are living lives 
        that are the direct opposite of what they should be living. Some should be living in their own executive homes 
        but the curse of the soil has caused them to end up in slums. Instead of working in well - paying companies, 
        they are self - employed and making meager earnings. Others who should have been running their own businesses 
        are loitering far from the places where God had intended to bless them. Think of David. When the prophet Samuel 
        was told to fill his horn and go to Jesse’s home, Samuel almost anointed the wrong people. Samuel was looking at 
        the physical appearance and so was surprised when God rejected the sons of Jesse. If David had sin or a curse 
        fighting him, one of his brothers would have ended up king in his place. The enemy had made sure that David 
        would be away from home when the prophet came. But thank God for a true servant of His, Samuel knew the voice 
        of the Almighty and so he followed God’s leading. Immediately David’s feet brought him before Samuel the prophet 
        knew David was the man whom God had favoured to be king. Mark you! David was the youngest son and he was only sixteen 
        when he was anointed king. So really it is not the age, nor the physical appearance nor the level of intelligence 
        that matters, it is having the earth supporting you and not fighting you. With Your Feet You Bless and With Your 
        Feet You Curse: The Authorization of the Twelve Jesus Christ summoned the twelve disciples and as He commissioned 
        them, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, every sickness and disease. He instructed them not to take a 
        travelling bag, an extra shirt, or sandals or a walking stick. By this commissioning Jesus put on each one of 
        them spiritual empowerment and authority and that’s why He said in Mathew 10: 14 ‘if anyone will not welcome 
        you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town’.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Other ways that Satan Attacks Your Feet:</h4>
      <p>
        You could be looking at your feet and from the physical perspective they appear normal and well, but this 
        might not be the case in the spirit realm. Satan removes your normal feet and gives you the following types 
        of feet.
        1. Cold Feet: This means that whenever there is an important thing that you have to do, you lose courage and 
        fail to do what you should. You develop a shifty state of mind and you keep changing the decisions you make.
        2. Itchy Feet: You develop anxiety that never leaves you. You are always worrying; you end up with a double 
        minded brain that is always on the move. A brain that can never be at rest and that can never be at peace.
        3. Puts Your Foot in Your Mouth: With your foot in your mouth, you always say the wrong thing or the inappropriate 
        thing. An illustration of this is as follows. ‘A certain unmarried lady was working in a particular church. 
        The pastor of that church was also a single man. The man of God busied himself in God’s service never giving a 
        thought about his state of singleness. Alas for him, one day the unmarried sister was having a chat with the 
        pastor’s secretary and as discussions go they started talking about relationships. And then out of the blue the 
        unmarried sister dropped a bombshell. She may have been joking or she may have been serious, but what she said 
        was the most inappropriate thing to say. Her parting words to the secretary were ‘’I am Mrs ………….and she 
        mentioned the pastor’s name. This sister’s words put every other single lady in that church in trouble because 
        the servant of God was insulted. All the ladies in that church had to pray a prayer of repentance for God to 
        forgive the entire church and not to pour His wrath of them. Yes! The devil can cause a person to say an 
        inappropriate thing and cause a lot of damage. 4. Tender feet: When you have tender feet, you remain a beginner 
        and a novice in everything you learn. You never mature and you remain inexperienced. Satan has given many 
        Christians tenderfeet such that they go to church every single Sunday, but even after a number of years in 
        church attendance, they still drink spiritual milk instead of eating spiritual meat which is the act of rightly 
        dividing the WORD of God. However when God removes all these other feet that satan has put on you, you become 
        realistic and slow in taking unnecessary risks. You become practical instead of being a dreamer. The Holy Spirit 
        of God then guides you to get onto your feet. This way you become established and prosperous. And using the 
        Name of Jesus Christ, you are able to put your foot down when satan brings his lies to you. In other words you 
        become firm and strong and soon you realize that as you walk around, you no longer step onto other people’s feet. 
        You live in peace and harmony with people around you. The Spirit of God controls your head, mouth, hands and 
        legs and you stop hurting yourself and hurting other people. You become stable at whatever work you lay your 
        hands to do and as days go by, you find that you are now able to foot all your bills. You are no longer in debt 
        and you can afford to pay for everything that you use. Isaiah 52: 7 says ‘How beautiful upon the mountains are 
        the feet of him that bringeth good tiding that publisheth peace that bringeth good tidings of peace, that 
        publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth’. My reader, May the Almighty have mercy upon you 
        today and put your feet on the ground so that you become a peace maker, because it is also written that 
        ‘Blessed are the Peace Makers’ in Jesus Mighty Name.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>How does satan attack your legs?</h4>
      <p>
        The devil uses his servants to design traps such that if you step on such, a certain part or all parts of 
        your life are contaminated. In the science of acupressure all nerve endings of the various body systems and 
        glands are mainly situated in the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. What does this theory mean 
        from a Christian perspective? Unless you are directly under the protection of the Blood of Jesus; the moment 
        your feet step onto a fowler’s trap, evil is installed into your life. This is done just like how you install 
        a programme into a computer. Or when an infected flash disk is comes into contact with your computer. 
        The virus in it enters into your computer and continues destroying various components until is it removed. 
        If the virus is not removed early enough, your computer crashes and you lose all your data. Since the soles of 
        your human feet carry all nerve endings, any part of your human body can be seriously damaged simply because you 
        stepped onto a trap. The other thing is that since human beings are both body and spirit, a satanic trap can 
        cause your physical or spiritual life to be destroyed.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Common Indicators of Feet Contamination</h4>
      <p>
        Dream Indicators such as dreaming walking barefoot which means shame, demotion and hardship has been 
        programmed into your life. Wandering around or that you are lost: A sure sign of vagabondism and rejection 
        is in your life. Physical Indicators include frequently losing jobs, breaking relationships, moving from 
        location to location even church to church and depending on other people for your livelihood. What happens 
        at the Iron Feet Anointing Altar? Three major things take place. First, since you have given God permission 
        to change your life, He takes charge and not only breaks but destroys every evil programme, structure, 
        system and tracking mark that the devil and his agents had put in your life. On this altar, the sick are 
        healed, rulers, powers and principalities are cast out while others flee on their own accord and evil that 
        has been witch crafted is totally destroyed. Second: God transforms your feet which are human flesh into 
        iron and bronze. Your feet become weapons for you to crush every form of spiritual wickedness. It is written 
        in Malachi 4: 3 “And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in 
        the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of Hosts.” When your feet have been changed, you can step on witchcraft 
        or any other type of evil and come to no harm as it is written in Psalm 91: 13 “Thou shalt tread upon the lion 
        and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.” Third: Your throne and your everlasting 
        position of authority over all wickedness of the enemy is re-established. For it is written in 
        2nd Chronicles 13: 5 “Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David 
        forever to even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?” When these things have taken place in the spirit 
        realm, then you in the physical realm; just like Asher in Deuteronomy 33: 24 - 25, are blessed; the spirit of 
        rejection leaves you and the earth yield it’s good for you. This way you eat the good of the land and remain 
        strong in all aspects of your physical life. This is a sure promise to all the spiritual seed of Abraham.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Is the Feet Anointing just for the Feet?</h4>
      <p>No! It stands for holistic healing. As soon as you step onto this altar your destiny file is brought to the 
        courts of Heaven. And God does as He has written in Malachi 3: 5 “And I will come near to you to judgment; 
        and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, 
        and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside 
        the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of Hosts.” So healing comes in many ways; 
        ranging from healing of demonic elephantiasis, cancer, barrenness of the womb, court cases, joblessness to 
        demonic insanity, epilepsy and education. God’s ways are as diverse as His Power is.</p>
